# ml-project-wildlife-collisions
Project for the Spring 2022 course "CS-C3240 - Machine Learning"
---
Using data from past wildlife-vehicle collisions that have happened in Finland, the aim of this project
is to predict the likelihood of a collision happening during a given timeframe of 6 hours. The data can
be freely attained from Statistics Finland (https://www.stat.fi/tup/kokeelliset-tilastot/riistaonnettomuudet/2022-02-09/index.html). The data points are wildlife collisions that have happened in 2021 in the Uusimaa region, where nearly a quarter of all wildlife accidents in Finland happen each year. Using information about the timeframe and the road type (and consequently the speed limit) this project aims to predict the likelihood of a wildlife-vehicle collision during a given timeframe.
