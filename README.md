# ml-project-wildlife-collisions
Project for the Spring 2022 course "CS-C3240 - Machine Learning"
---
Using data from past wildlife-vehicle collisions that have happened in Finland, the aim of this project
is to predict the likelihood of a collision happening during a given timeframe of 10 minutes. The data can
be freely attained from Statistics Finland (https://www.stat.fi/tup/kokeelliset-tilastot/riistaonnettomuudet/2022-02-09/index.html). The data points are wildlife collisions that have happened in 2021 in the Uusimaa region, where nearly a quarter of all wildlife accidents in Finland happen each year. Using information about the timeframe this project aims to predict the likelihood of a wildlife-vehicle collision during a given timeframe.
